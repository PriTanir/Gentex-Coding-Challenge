Hi There! Here are a few points and explanations regarding my solution:


1. I used object oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism (run time using method over riding), data abstraction. I did this by using an interface called InterfaceShape. This interface contains abstract methods that are overriden in each of the classes.
2. I used double data type and did not do any rounding off so as to display the full value as is.
3. I used the shoelace formula for area of an irregular polygon and calculated lengths of each side of polygon and summed them up to get my perimeter.
4. I read from the given txt file as input and wrote to another txt file called 'output.txt' which is comma separated insise it. I did not use the .csv extension, however, following the same format the input given to me.
5. I was unable to find the time to calculate centroid so I have worked it into my design but returned a 0 except for a circle whose centroid is same as its center.
6. I used a switch case to identify which shape was being read. This makes it easier to add a new shape in the future. All we have to do is add another class for the new shape and write another case statement for it.
7. I was unable to write unit tests but i did manually test my code with smaller input files. If I were to write them, i would write it for each method defining my input and expected outputs.
8. If needed, please let me know and I can do the unit tests and the centroid calculations after November 2nd, which is when my mid term exams end! Thank you!
9. I had fun doing this, thank you!
